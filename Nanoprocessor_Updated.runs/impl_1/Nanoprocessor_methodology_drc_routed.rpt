LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Ins_Decoder_0/__9/i_, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Ins_Decoder_0/Jmp_on_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ROM_0/MuxA_Sel_reg[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Ins_Decoder_0/MuxA_Sel_reg[0]/CLR, Ins_Decoder_0/MuxA_Sel_reg[1]/CLR, Ins_Decoder_0/MuxA_Sel_reg[2]/CLR, Ins_Decoder_0/MuxB_Sel_reg[0]/CLR, Ins_Decoder_0/MuxB_Sel_reg[1]/CLR, Ins_Decoder_0/MuxB_Sel_reg[2]/CLR, Ins_Decoder_0/Load_Sel_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ROM_0/Sub_Sel_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Ins_Decoder_0/Sub_Sel_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
